# Take-a-break
Time Tracker Application
Overview
This C# application tracks the current time and calculates when to take a break based on a set duration. It helps users monitor their time and get reminders to take a break after a specific period of work.

Features
Displays the current time and the scheduled break time.
Sets a 20-minute period for a break after the current time.
Checks if it's time for a break and notifies the user when the break time arrives.
Uses Thread.Sleep to simulate waiting for a break time.
Compares current time and break time to notify the user when it's time to take a break.
Requirements
.NET Core or .NET Framework.
Microsoft Visual Basic namespace (Microsoft.VisualBasic) is used for string comparison.
How It Works
The application first gets the current time using DateTime.Now.
It then sets a break time by adding 20 minutes to the current time.
The program sleeps for 20 minutes (simulating a break reminder).
After waking up, the program compares the current time with the break time.
If the current time matches the break time, a reminder message is displayed.
